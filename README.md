#Getsquare_AdminOrderName (Beecraigs)
A Magento extension which helps businesses identify which user processed a Backend (Admin) order.

##Description

This small but handy extension logs the username against a Backend (Admin) processed order and displays this in the order grid.

##Installation

If you make use of modman use the "modman clone" command from the root of your Magento instance to install. If you don't use modman download the zip or clone repository and merge (excluding the modman file) with your Magento instance.

### Notes
The column in the admin grid will only show usernames of Backend users. Frontend processed orders will have a null value for this field.
